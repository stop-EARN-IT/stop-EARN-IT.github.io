# STOP The EARN_IT ACT OF 2022
## We stopped it in 2020
They probably think everyone was fatigued after the first time and they are doing it again. We need people to stop the EARN-IT ACT OF 2022.

Go to [https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-earn-it-act-to-save-our-privacy](https://act.eff.org/action/stop-the-earn-it-act-to-save-our-privacy) and write a letter to your senator.

Hard luck if they support it(But try to explain it to them).

A Petition will be launched on the GH repo for this site at some point.
